Description: # NewLifeUtils
        ## Recent change
        The main preparation of all files for collaboration with github is completed. Now I can continue developing the ported code with github's participation. Over time, I will add full documentation and a lot of useful features
        
        ## About the project
        In fact, there is active development, repeated rewriting of the code. All actions are published on github for orderly storage of changes and fixing all my actions. I don't encourage you to use my code. My goal is to learn how to write programs beautifully and learn how to use github. If you have any ideas, criticism, or suggestions , I'm happy to listen
        Now this is the 5th attempt to rewrite the code beautifully, each time I change the very structure of the code. In General, I didn't really study the language features, so my code will be disgusting to a professional programmer. Maybe someday I will achieve the effect that I need
        
        ## Project idea.
        Simplify the development of some elements of more significant and large projects with ready-made features. I'm not ready to use external Python modules, besides, it's better to write something yourself and experiment, gain experience. In the future, I will not publish such children's content on such a large platform. I'm just learning
        
        ## Plans and current changes
        In fact, there are quite a lot of them, but they are constantly changing, I just don't have the strength to constantly change something in a bunch of files at the same time
